<h1>The New Typography [1923]</h1>

<h2>Laszlo Moholy-Nagy</h2>

<h3>Typography is a tool of communication.</h3>

<h4>It must be communication in its most intense form.</h4>

<p>The emphasis must be on absolute clarity since this distinguishes the character of our own writing from that of ancient pictographic forms. 

<p>Our intellectual relationship to the world is individual-exact (e.g., this individual-exact relationship is in a state of transition toward a collective-exact orientation). </p>

<p>This is in contrast to the ancient individual-amorphous and later collective-amorphous mode of communication. </p>

<p>Therefore priority: unequivocal clarity in all typographical compositions. </p>

<p>Legibility-communication must never be impaired by an a priori esthetics.</p> 

<p>Letters may never be forced into a preconceived framework, for instance a square.</p>
